Evrete is a rules engine based on the Rete algorithm, which is used for efficient pattern matching in rule-based systems. In Evrete, the concepts of **stateful sessions** and **stateless sessions** refer to how the rules engine manages data and executes rules. The key differences between stateful and stateless sessions revolve around how the Rete network changes and how rules are executed.

### **Stateful Sessions**
A **stateful session** maintains the state of the Rete network across multiple invocations. This means that the session keeps track of the facts (data) that have been inserted, updated, or deleted, and the Rete network retains its internal state (such as partial matches and activations of rules).

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **Persistent State**:
   - Facts inserted into the session remain in the Rete network until explicitly removed or updated.
   - The session maintains memory of all facts and their relationships, allowing incremental changes to the data without reprocessing everything.

2. **Incremental Updates**:
   - When new facts are added, updated, or removed, the Rete network only processes the changes (delta processing) rather than reevaluating all facts.
   - This makes stateful sessions efficient for scenarios where data evolves over time and rules need to be reevaluated based on changes.

3. **Rule Execution**:
   - Rules are triggered automatically whenever changes to the facts cause conditions in the rules to be satisfied.
   - The session can execute rules multiple times as facts are added, updated, or removed.

4. **Use Case**:
   - Stateful sessions are ideal for long-running processes or applications where data changes incrementally, such as monitoring systems, workflow engines, or real-time decision-making systems.

### **Stateless Sessions**
A **stateless session** does not maintain the state of the Rete network between invocations. Instead, it processes facts in a "batch mode," where all facts are provided at once, and the rules are executed based on the provided data. After execution, the session discards all facts and resets the Rete network.

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **No Persistent State**:
   - Facts are not retained in the Rete network after rule execution.
   - Each invocation starts with a fresh Rete network, and facts must be reinserted for every execution.

2. **Full Reevaluation**:
   - The Rete network processes all facts from scratch during each invocation.
   - There is no incremental processing; all facts are reevaluated regardless of whether they have changed since the last invocation.

3. **Rule Execution**:
   - Rules are executed once for the provided batch of facts, and the session does not track changes or maintain activations beyond the current invocation.

4. **Use Case**:
   - Stateless sessions are suitable for scenarios where data is processed in discrete batches, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, report generation, or situations where the data context is ephemeral.

### **Comparison of Rete Network Behavior**
| Aspect                | Stateful Session                         | Stateless Session                       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Fact Management**   | Facts are retained and tracked.          | Facts are discarded after execution.    |
| **Rete Network State**| Persistent; retains partial matches.     | Reset after each invocation.            |
| **Processing**        | Incremental (delta processing).          | Full reevaluation of all facts.         |
| **Rule Execution**    | Rules execute automatically on changes.  | Rules execute once per invocation.      |
| **Performance**       | Efficient for incremental changes.       | Efficient for batch processing.         |

### **Choosing Between Stateful and Stateless Sessions**
- **Stateful sessions** are preferred when:
  - You need to handle continuously evolving data.
  - You want to avoid reprocessing unchanged facts.
  - You require rules to react dynamically to incremental changes.

- **Stateless sessions** are preferred when:
  - You are processing isolated batches of data.
  - You do not need to retain facts or track changes over time.
  - Simplicity and one-off processing are more important than efficiency for incremental updates.

---

### **Conclusion**
The main difference between stateful and stateless sessions lies in how the Rete network manages facts and executes rules:
- **Stateful sessions** retain facts and perform incremental updates, making them suitable for dynamic, long-running processes.
- **Stateless sessions** discard facts after execution and reevaluate everything from scratch, making them ideal for batch processing or ephemeral data contexts.

Understanding these differences helps you choose the appropriate session type based on your application's requirements.<!---
